                                    Quantum protocols are a set of rules and
                                    procedures that leverage the principles of
                                    quantum mechanics to enable secure and
                                    efficient communication. Basically,
                                    regulations to let quantum devices

                <p class="intro">
                    Just some quick refreshers, we need to go over the concepts
                    of superposition and measurement.

                    <p>
                        Alice and Bob can put qubits into superposition by
                        introducing a Hadamard gate. The qubit will enter the
                        plus state if it is in the 0 state. And if you apply a
                        Hadamard gate to 1 state, it will turn into the minus
                        state. They must reapply the Hadamard gate to take their
                        qubit out of superposition. It turns the plus state into
                        the 0 state and the minus state into the 1 state.
                    </p>

                <div class="measurement">
                    <p class="bold">Measurement</p>
                    <p>
                        Regarding measurement now, measurement collapses
                        superposition. If a qubit was in superposition, it has
                        an equal probability of measuring the 0 or 1 state.
                        However, if you decide to measure the state, then it
                        collapses to either state. And subsequently, it remains
                        in a collapsed state. We'll see why this matters in the
                        next section.

                            Imagine this scenario: two people, Alice and Bob,
                            want to share a highly confidential message. They
                            are scared their message will be intercepted, so
                            they want to encrypt it. First of all, they have to
                            settle on an encryption key. But how will they
                            transfer the key to each other? If the key is
                            intercepted, then there's no point in encrypting the
                            message. They need a more secure way to transfer the
                            key! They can use Quantum Key Distribution!!

                            There are several versions of QKD; we'll focus on
                            the BB84 version: <br />Note that the key they want
                            to transfer is "01101".

                        Alice encodes the key into qubits into the plus and
                        minus states. She then randomly puts some of her qubits
                        in superposition (You'll see why later). E.g. the third
                        and last qubits. She transfers the state "01-0-".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bob receives the qubits and applies a Hadamard to some
                        random qubits. His goal is to try to guess which ones
                        Alice put into superposition and take them out of it. He
                        settles on the 1st and 5th qubits, and the state becomes
                        "+1-01". He collapses the state and measures "11101".
                        This is not the original key, but don't worry; we'll see
                        how they fix the issue in the next step.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They then relay to each other which qubits they put into
                        superposition and which they didn't on a classical
                        channel. For instance, in the following example, Alice's
                        would correspond to "NNSNS", and Bob's would be "SNNNS".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They ignore the ones they disagree with. They both end
                        up with the state 101 as the key!
                    </p>

                <div class="with">

                    <p>
                        Issue solved? Well, almost, but not entirely. What if
                        Eve (an eavesdropper) was listening?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's run through the scenario again. The first few
                        steps will remain the same. However, when Alice
                        transfers the state, Eve will measure the key. She can
                        apply Hadamards like Bob did or measure them by
                        collapsing the superposition. For example, if she
                        applies a Hadamard gate on the 5th qubit. The state will
                        change from "01-0-" to "01-01". Bob is unaware of this
                        and continues on. Once again, he applies the Hadamard
                        gate on the 1st and last qubits. He gets the state
                        "+1-0-" and measures 11000.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The procedure will continue as normal. However, after
                        discarding the 1st and 3rd qubits, Alice ends up with
                        the key 101 and Bob with 100. To stop this from
                        happening, they double-check if there have been any
                        eavesdroppers. They compare some bits of the key and
                        look for any disparities. They notice that the last
                        qubit has been tampered with, so they change the channel
                        and repeat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This procedure will include way more than 5 bits! Even
                        if you discard and sacrifice half your bits but have 100
                        remaining, you will have enough to form a secure
                        encryption key!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, some of you might think that the procedure
                        could easily be breached if Eve copies the state of the
                        qubits and also intercepts the classical communication
                        where they tell each other which qubits have had a
                        Hadamard applied to them. However, due to the no-cloning
                        theorem, Eve can't copy the state in the first place!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alice and Bob can now share their secret message
                        confidentially.

                                This allows for the transfer of qubits while
                                perfectly maintaining the qubit's state. The
                                significant feature is that it can transfer
                                qubits over immense distances, even into space!
                                However, before you get too excited, you can't
                                move matter from one point to another via
                                dematerialisation and materialising in another
                                location. You can only transfer the information
                                to another qubit, not the qubit itself. Here's a
                                phenomenal explanation offered by The University
                                of Chicago and UC Santa Barbara that explains
                                the protocol in more detail. Beware that they
                                talk a lot about the maths behind it. However,
                                don't let that phase you; you can ignore it to
                                get a general understanding of Quantum
                                teleportation.

                                Superdense coding enables the transmission of
                                classical information more efficiently than
                                classical methods. It utilises entanglement to
                                encode two classical bits of information into a
                                single qubit, which can then be transmitted.
