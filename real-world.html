                        <p>
                            Say you have a coin, and you want to see if it's
                            biased or not. In this hypothetical situation, the
                            coin flip outcomes are strictly probabilistic; if
                            biased, you would get the same outcome twice;
                            otherwise, you would get different outcomes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The table shows you would have four different
                            scenarios based on two flips. You could get HH or
                            TT, both of which indicate that the coin is biased,
                            or you could get either HT or TH, which would
                            suggest that the coin is fair.

                        <p>
                            Thinking classically, how could you determine
                            whether the coin is fair? You must figure it out via
                            brute force and flip it twice. Is there another
                            better way to figure this out?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Well, by harnessing the power of quantum computers,
                            you can. We can use a circuit like the one above. So
                            imagine this: you are in a parallel universe, and
                            you can simultaneously stimulate both coin flips.
                            Then you can compare if the results are identical or
                            different.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Quantumly, you would first put all the outcomes into
                            superposition by applying a Hadamard gate. Then you
                            would compare the two outcomes; if they are similar,
                            you would get the result zero; however, if they
                            aren't, you would get one. Sounds simple? Well, yes,
                            that was the very first quantum algorithm. As time
                            progressed, so did the algorithms; you will build on
                            what you learned today in the following examples.

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            Finally, say you wanted to generalise from
                            coin-flipping to other useful operations. A general
                            use case for this algorithm would be anything that
                            included a function, and you could test if the
                            function was constant or biased.

                            albeit more mathematically, watch this brilliant
                            video by Artur Ekert. He includes details about

                            You have a picture, and you want to find Wally. How
                            would you go about finding Wally using a computer?
                            Well, you would have to look at each character and
                            compare it to the characteristics of Wally, and if
                            it matches, you have found Wally, and if not, you
                            keep going.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This method would take O(n) operations given that
                            there are n characters. However, is there a faster
                            way you could do this? Yes, there is! See Grover's
                            Algorithm Circuit, which does it in O(n^1/2) or
                            O(square root n) steps. A quadratic speedup!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At a high level, what we need to do, is to visualise
                            every possible character at the same time; then, for
                            the characters that share characteristics with
                            Wally, we increase the probability of measuring it,
                            and then for the ones that don't, we decrease the
                            chance of measuring it. If we repeat this process
                            root n times, we should have a very high (almost
                            certain) probability of measuring Wally.

                        <p>Let's go into more detail now.</p>
                        <p>
                            In this scenario, there are only eight characters.
                            The first step is assigning each character a state
                            to simulate all the states simultaneously. And since
                            three qubits allow for eight states, we only need to
                            use three qubits. To demonstrate this, character one
                            will have the state 000, character two 001 and so
                            on, until character eight has 111. We must apply a
                            Hadamard gate to each of the three qubits to
                            visualise all the states simultaneously.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second stage is Amplitude Amplification, a
                            process that increases the amplitude of one state
                            while reducing the amplitude of all the other states
                            in the superposition. In this algorithm, amplitude
                            amplification is created by an oracle and Grover's
                            operator combined.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To visualise this, here's a diagram that shows all
                            the states after putting them into equal
                            superposition. They all have the same probability of
                            being Wally. Note that Wally is at the state w.

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            Now we will see what the oracle and Grover's
                            operator do to the superposition. The oracle is
                            encoded with the characteristics of Wally. For
                            instance. a red and white striped shirt, jeans and a
                            cane. It will compare all the states simultaneously,
                            but when a state matches the characteristics, it
                            will change the amplitude of the state to a
                            minus—essentially flagging it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Secondly, Grover's operator looks for the mean
                            amplitude and rotates each state about the mean. So
                            all the states apart from the flagged one would
                            decrease. Since there is such a significant
                            disparity between Wally's state and the mean, the
                            new amplitude of the state would be huge.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This process will repeat for approximately root n
                            times, and then you can measure out Wally with a
                            high probability!

            <h3>Shor's Algorithm</h3>
            <h4>Craking RSA Encryption</h4>

            <div class="pairs">

                        <p>
                            Imagine you have a secret message locked using RSA
                            encryption, which relies on the difficulty of
                            factoring large numbers into prime factors. Breaking
                            this encryption requires finding the two prime
                            numbers multiplied to create the encryption key.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If we used a classical computer to break the RSA
                            encryption, we would have to try many possible
                            combinations of prime factors until we find the
                            correct ones. This process would take a long time
                            and require a lot of computational power.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The fastest way to currently do this would be using
                            the Number Field Sieve Algorithm
                        </p>

                            However, Shor's powerful quantum algorithm offers a
                            much faster approach to factorising large numbers.
                            Here's how it works:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shor's algorithm starts by utilising the power of
                            quantum superposition. It allows us to consider
                            multiple possible combinations of prime factors
                            simultaneously.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shor's algorithm applies a mathematical operation
                            called the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to
                            analyse the combinations of prime factors. This
                            operation enables the quantum computer to identify
                            patterns in the factors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shor's algorithm uses quantum phase estimation to
                            measure the periods or patterns of certain
                            mathematical functions related to the factors. These
                            periods contain information about the prime factors
                            themselves.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="pair pair9">
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            The measurement then collapses the superposition
                            into a specific set of factors, the prime numbers we
                            sought.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once the prime factors are obtained, we can break
                            the RSA encryption and access the secret message.
                        </p>

                            Sounds complicated? Well, it was for me when I first
                            learned about it. This video by minutephysics helped
                            me to understand the algorithm quite well
